# CS754-Assignments

This is a repository of the assignments done by me and my teammate [Pulkit Agarwal](https://github.com/PulkitAgr113) for the course [CS754: Advanced Image Processing](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/CS754_Spring2022/) at IIT Bombay in Spring 2022.

## Assignment 1 - Compressed Sensing
This assignment was about proving some commonly used results in CS theory such as those related to bounding coherence and some related to Basis Pursuit. The assignment also involved implementing Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm.

## Assignment 2 - Compressed Sensing
This assignment covered the restricted isometry property in great depth and also touched upon application of compressed sensing in Dorfmann pooling.

## Assignment 3 - Tomography and Compressed Sensing
This assignment served as an introduction to tomography with some basic analysis on the Radon transform and using the L1-L2 package in MATLAB to perform tomographic reconstruction. The assignment also covered implementing ISTA and deriving some statistical bounds in the LASSO regression problem.

## Assignment 4 - Dictionary Learning
This assignment introduced dictionary learning and covered some basic dictionary manipulations. We also touched upon Non-Negative Factorisation and Non-Negative Sparse Coding and its application in Poisson denoising.

## Assignment 5 - Statistics of Natural Images and Matrix Recovery
The last assigmnent covered some results in 'Low-Rank Modeling and Its Applications in Image Analysis', 'Exact Matrix Completion via Convex Optimization', 'Guaranteed Minimum-Rank Solutions of Linear Matrix Equations via Nuclear Norm Minimization' and 'User assisted separation of reflections from a single image using a sparsity prior'
